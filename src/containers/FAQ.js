        <h4>Question: What is a Decentralized Exchange?</h4>
        <h5>
          Answer: A decentralized exchange is an exchange that does not rely on
          a third party to hold customersâ€™ funds. Instead, decentralized
          exchanges such as EtherDEX facilitate trades that occur directly
          between customers, on a peer to peer basis.
